      <p>
        Welcome to the draft! The <strong>{name}</strong> has been allocated
        <strong>{quota}</strong>
        slots in total. As a lab head, you may pick at most <strong>{remainingDraftees}</strong>
        more students in this round. The following students have selected your lab as their
        <strong>{currRound}{suffix}</strong>
        choice. Simply click on the student's name to toggle the selection. By default, none are selected.
        Note that you <em>not</em> required to exhaust your entire allocation in this round. You may
        hold off on some of your slots for the next round.
      </p>
      <p>
        When ready, you may press the <strong>"Submit"</strong> button. Empty submissions are
        allowed. In any case, all lab heads must submit their picks before the next round
        <em>automatically</em> begins. All lab heads and administrators will be notified when this happens.
