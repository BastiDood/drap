        <h2>Email Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            To enable email notifications, one of the draft administrators must first volunteer themselves to be the
            <strong>Designated Sender</strong> of the system. All emails will be sent on behalf of the
            <dfn>designated sender</dfn>. There are <em>no</em> special Gmail accounts; the personal email account of
            the designated sender will be used for all email notifications
            <em>as if they had sent the notification themselves</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the security implications and risks of impersonation, the sensitive privilege to send emails on behalf
            of administrators <em>requires</em> elevated consent. Thus, before becoming a designated sender, an
            administrator must first volunteer themselves to be a <strong>Candidate Sender</strong> via the button below
            (which will be disabled if the administrator has already volunteered previously). Pressing the button redirects
            the user to the Google consent screen.
        </p>
        <form method="get" action="/oauth/login/">
            <input type="hidden" name="extended" />
            <button type="submit" {disabled} class="not-prose variant-filled-primary btn w-full">
                <span><Icon src={ShieldExclamation} class="h-8" /></span>
                <span>Volunteer as a Candidate Sender</span>
            </button>
        </form>
        <p>
            Consenting candidate senders are listed on this page. Using the <strong>"Promote"</strong> buton, each
            candidate sender may then be promoted as the designated sender of the system. Analogously, the
            <strong>"Demote"</strong> button demotes a designated sender back to candidate sender status. Lastly, an
            administrator may press the <strong>"Remove"</strong> to revoke their consent.
