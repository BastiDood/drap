  <h1>DRAP: Draft Ranking Automated Processor</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>DRAP</strong>: the <strong>Draft Ranking Automated Processor</strong> for the
    <a href="https://up.edu.ph/" target="_blank">University of the Philippines</a>
    <a href="https://upd.edu.ph/" target="_blank">Diliman</a>
    - <a href="https://dcs.upd.edu.ph/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>'s yearly
    draft of research lab assignments. In a nutshell, this web application automates the mechanics
    of the draft:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      All participating students register for the draft by providing their full name, email, student
      number, and lab rankings (ordered by preference) to the draft administrators.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>The <strong>regular draft process</strong> begins. For each round in the draft:</span>
      <ol class="list-[lower-alpha]">
        <li>
          Draft administrators notify (typically via email) the lab heads about all of the students
          that have chosen their respective research lab as the first choice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each lab selects a subset (i.e., possibly none, some, or all) of these first-choice
          students to accept them into the lab. After this point, the selected students are
          considered to be "drafted" and are thus no longer part of the next rounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          The next round begins when all of the labs have submitted their preferences. This time
          around, the second-choice preferences of the <em>remaining</em> students are evaluated (and
          so on).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>
        Should there be students remaining by the end of the regular draft process, the
        <strong>lottery round</strong> begins.
      </span>
      <ol class="list-[lower-alpha]">
        <li>
          Before the randomization stage, draft administrators first negotiate with participating
          labs (that have remaining slots) to check if any of the labs would like to accept some of
          the remaining students immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          After manual negotiation and intervention, the remaining students are shuffled and
          assigned to participating labs in a round-robin fashion.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The draft concludes when all registered participants have been assigned to a lab.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    All interactions with the application require UP Mail authentication. To <a
      href="/oauth/login/"
      rel="external">sign in with Google</a
    >, simply press the login button at the lower left corner of the dashboard. When logged in, the
    button functions as a logout button instead. The next steps depend on your role in the draft.
